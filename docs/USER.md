- **Location-based search** — enter a city or use the interactive Leaflet map to drop a pin
- **Brand pages** — browse all cars from a specific manufacturer

Each car card shows the photo, price per day, rating, and agency name. Clicking opens the full detail page with specs, documentation status, reviews, and a booking button.
